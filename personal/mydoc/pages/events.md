Light events
=============
2019-11-06


Note: we use the [Light_Events](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Events) service under the hood.


The Core/Light will dispatch the following events:


- Light.on_route_found: when a route matched. The argument is a [Light_Event](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light/blob/master/doc/api/Ling/Light/Events/LightEvent.md) object which has a route variable containing the matching [route](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light/blob/master/doc/pages/route.md) array.
