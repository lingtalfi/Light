Provider service, subscriber service
-----------------

As the name suggests, the **provider service** is a service which provides something.

For instance, a mailer service, or a service to display html lists.

Then the subscriber services are the ones using the provider services.


Usually, the **provider (service)** requires the subscriber to register before it can use the provider services, hence the terminology provider/subscriber. 






Nugget

A **nugget**, in the light lingo, often refers to a bit of service configuration.

Usually, when a [subscriber service](#provider-service-subscriber-service) uses the service of a provider, a **nugget** is required
to have full control over the behaviour of the executed service.
