As the name suggests, the **provider service** is a service which provides something.

For instance, a mailer service, or a service to display html lists.

Then the subscriber services are the ones using the provider services.


Usually, the **provider (service)** requires the subscriber to register before it can use the provider services, hence the terminology provider/subscriber.
